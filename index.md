## About Us
We are Nathan and Jackie Watkins. We have four children: Nathan III, Tyler, Hannah, and Ezra. Nathan grew up as a missionary kid in the Ivory Coast, West Africa, and Jackie grew up in Brownsburg, Indiana. We were appointed by ABWE as missionaries to Thailand in the summer of 2021. Our goal is to reach lost Thais through church planting, discipleship, and leadership development
